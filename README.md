# Private Search Google

Google knows a whole lot about us. It carries out over 40,000 searches a second – and all of the details of these searches are logged for the company’s benefit. Maybe you think a search engine shouldn’t have that much reach into our lives? Well, there are options to make your searches private – but how private are they really?

To perform a private Google search, users should leverage the Tor web browser without a Google account. Popular search engines like Startpage and Searx provide Google results anonymously. The private browsing mode or Google Chrome incognito tab simply clears browsing history and data when closed.
